  Description:
  ------------
    This file contains the type definition for the "term" class.
    We are representing a Boolean term using two unsigned integers, read
    as bit-vectors, according to Theorem 5 in X. Wu's paper "Efficient
    Implementation of Regular Languages using r-afa".  This theorem states:

        For every Boolean function f (defined on a set S of n Boolean
        variables) that can be expressed as a single term, there exist two
        n-bit vectors a and b s.t.
        f(u)=1 iff (a&u)^b = 0 , for all u in B**n.
	Here, & and ^ are the bitwise AND and OR operators, respectively.

   In other words, vector a flags which variables of the n possible variables
   the term includes, and vector b flags which of the variables flagged by a
   are non-negated.  A term pointer is included as a member of the term
   construct so that terms may be linked together to form a Boolean function
   in disjunctive normal form.

   The i/o functions for terms are defined in /classes/afa/dnf/funct.src
   The headers are:

      istream& operator>>(istream& in, term& t)
      ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const term& t)
      void term::print(ostream& out)const
