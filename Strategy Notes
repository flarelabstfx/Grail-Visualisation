- Self Looping
- Bi-directional lines

- Swap x positions of states to get relevant states closer to each other
- Push All states above certain point so that you can essentially insert into a certain position of y
- Multiply all x and/or y values by a certain editable constant. Even could be an adjustable option for users.

- Remember this algorithim does not account for transitions being able to go underneeth states as it only looks for the highest value. This would likely be a good one to add early one as it would still remain as a good starting point for improvment strategies that build on this.
