% Drawing a shape
% "draw" = outer (line) colour
% "fill" = inner colour; "blue!10!white" is a way of mixing blue with white with a ratio of 10%
% "thick" = makes the outer line thicker than usual
% "(a,b) rectangle (c,d)" draws a rectangle with bottom-left coordinate (a,b) and top-right coordinate (c,d)

% Adding a node (for, e.g., text labels)
% "draw=none" = no line will be drawn around the node
% "at (a,b)" positions the node centered on the coordinate (a,b)
% The node's text goes in the {braces}

% Defining coordinates and drawing lines
% A coordinate is just a named point in the drawing (e.g., coordinate (1,1.75) is named "A" here)
% "(B) -- (A)" draws a straight line from coordinate B to coordinate A
% Special attributes/properties of the line can be given, like "color=red"
% "-latex" is an arrow type with a triangular head
% You can draw other types of arrows by including, e.g., "->" in the [brackets] instead
